PROPOSE NEW OBJECTIVE?
compare adaptive game to non-adaptive game, see which is more enjoyable/better

embed "questionaire" in game: rate game 1 (easy) to 5 (hard)

result:
adaptive: many game was fun. better written exam scores?
non-adaptive: many game was too hard/easy, few game fun. bad written exams scores?

DOCU

CHAPTER 3
3.1 add school name
3.3 change series of questions to series of programming problems (more levels after tutorial levels)

CHAPTER 4
1. Determine basic programming concepts to teach:
- variables and operators
- conditional branching
- loops
- functions

2. Determine game components:
- platforming game (physics engine)
- programming game (compiler)
- level design (how the levels work: first tutorials, then actual levels)
- adaptive component (record player performance)
- user accounts

3. Design and develop the game modules
- scrum model
- screenshots of output game?

4. design database
- binary file
	User
	- username
	- 
	

5. test and evaluate through game scores and written exam:
- actual testing
- graphs and shit

Why game/e-learning?
- more fun
- learners become more interested
- high level of interactivity in games can be used for dynamic difficulty adjustment which books/etc dont have
- more effective than face-to-face instruction (show chart from [3])
- 2.1 e-learning 2.0 from [1]
- learner-centered approach

Why adaptive?
- more challenging for skilled learners, easier for slow learners
- improved efficiency, effectiveness, more enjoyment of the learning experience [2] conclusio
- Chen et al. (Chen & Duh, 2008) states that the difficulty level of the recommended content is highly relevant to learners’ abilities. Furthermore, an appropriate content can result in learner’s cognitive overhead and disorientation during a learning process

DDA

# Player ability can be measured by any number of parameters (DDA factors in todo.d). This calculation is a heuristic function called the "challenge function." This function maps a given game state into a value that specifies how easy or difficult the game feels to the user at a specific moment.

# Model assumes linear relation between a problem solving ability and a logarithm of time to solve a problem. Why logarithm instead of untrasformed time:
	- problem solving times have a natural "multiplicative" not additive nature. e.g. if A is better problem solver than B, A can solve 0.8 times as fast as B, not 20 seconds faster than B
	- previous research on response times in item response theory successfully used this assumption [5][6][7]

Ability can be measured by the time to achieve the goal, the number of lives lost during the level (number of retries), or the number of points scored. [8]

# getting to know the student in a virtual learning setting is also a significant challenge (Ahmad, 2004)

# The fine-grained interactivity provided by games can produce more detailed information about the interaction of the students that any other kind of non-interactive content. Gathering and processing this information can open up new opportunities in terms of automatic assessment and student profiling

Besides, there is an emergent trend in Technology-Enhanced Learning advocating
for the use of educational video games and game-like simulations (Tang, 2007;
Torrente, Lavín-Mera, Moreno-Ger, & Fernández-Manjón, 2008). Educational video
games present advantages such as their suitability to convey concepts (Hamid,
2001) or to increase students’ motivation (J. P. Gee, 2003). Games also provide
short feedback cycles that foster constructivist learning approaches in which students
implicitly formulate and test hypothesis, receiving immediate feedback from the
system (Pivec & Dziabenko, 2004).

objective
- controlled experiment? group a - dynamic, group b - linear. then see which is more effective/satisfying etc

Assessing the leaner steps: [2]
a valid instructional system design sequence:
a) present some introductory material
b) follow with the presentation of a rule or concept
c) provide a range of illustrative examples
d) give liberal practice opportunities
e) summarize and call for reflection


# EVENTS OF INSTRUCTION according to Gagne[9]
necessary conditions for learning, basis for designing instruction
1. Gain the learner’s attention (reception).
2. Inform the learner of the objectives (expectancy).
3. Stimulate recall of prior learning (retrieval).
4. Present the learning stimulus (selective perception).
5. Provide learning guidance (semantic encoding).
6. Elicit appropriate performance (responding).
7. Provide feedback (reinforcement).
8. Assess the learner’s performance (retrieval).
9. Enhance retention and transfer (generalization).

# WHAT TO LOOK FOR IN E-LEARNING GAMES [3] p 397
goals activities consequences are aligned to desired learning outcomes
guidance is included to help learners reach instructional goals
explanations are incorporated between play rounds
self-explanation questions
visual support
unguided exploration is avoided
game goal complexity adapt to learner
game is easy to use via simple GUI design and pretraining (tutorials)

# EVIDENCE BASED PRACTICE [3] p 50
when designing a course, base decisions on sources including:
- fads (what is commonly done)
- opinions (what experts advise)
- politics (what the subject-matter experts or legal dept advises)
- ideology (what seems consistent with a particular approach to instruction)
