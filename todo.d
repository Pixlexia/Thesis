TODO

Coding
- bigass command list
- reset the counter for inner loops after first iteration of parent/outer loop
- function commands   
- "victory" screen after level complete
- pause menu
- more levels

Bugs:
- minor bug: when if-condition is false, error commands inside the if body are also skipped
- fix gametext when getting computer data

Art
- all sprites

Polishing
- movement of variables and values when assigning and arithmetic operations
- main menu
- world menu

Done:
- exit
- inventory
	- interact command
	- store computer value to inventory
- operators
- if else commands
- loop commands
- climb <-- not very elegant, fix/tweak?
- implement level system
- boundary collision

Ideas:
- "Unlockables:" on level 1-5, can use red slot only, but on lv 5, before finishing level, unlock the blue slot
- can set speed of commandDelays. can be used in determining DDA? (higher delay means player is dumber)

possible DDA factors:
- time
- number of moves
- number of retries
- number of errors
- commanddelay?
- number of instruction reread
- number of variables used
