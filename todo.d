TODO

Coding
- exit
- bigass command list
- inventory
	- interact command
	- store computer value to inventory
- operators
- if else commands
- loop commands
- function commands   
- boundary collision
- "victory" screen after level complete

Art
- all sprites

Polishing
- movement of variables and values when assigning and arithmetic operations
- main menu
- world menu

Done:
- climb <-- not very elegant, fix/tweak?
- implement level system

Bugs:
- minor bug: when if-condition is false, error commands inside the if body are also skipped

Ideas:
- "Unlockables:" on level 1-5, can use red slot only, but on lv 5, before finishing level, unlock the blue slot
- can set speed of commandDelays. can be used in determining DDA? (higher delay means player is dumber)
