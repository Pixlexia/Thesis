TODO

Coding
- make the levels
- user login
- user load data
- user save data
- record user data (if tutorials finished)
- adaptive algorithm
- what happens if finish tutorial/some levels then go to world again?
- interest level?

- reset the counter for inner loops after first iteration of parent/outer loop
- function tutorials

Bugs:
- minor bug: when if-condition is false, error commands inside the if body are also skipped
- fix gametext when getting computer data

Art
- all sprites

Polishing
- "victory" screen after level complete?
- state transitions

Done:
- recrod performance (see DDA factors)
- exit
- inventory
	- interact command
	- store computer value to inventory
- operators
- if else commands
- loop commands
- climb <-- not very elegant, fix/tweak?
- implement level system
- boundary collision

Ideas:
- can set speed of commandDelays. can be used in determining DDA? (higher delay means player is dumber)

possible DDA factors:
- time (solving only, not including running program + platformer game?)
- number of moves
- number of retries
- number of errors
- commanddelay?
- number of instruction reread
- number of variables used
